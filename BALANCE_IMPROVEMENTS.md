# Major Balance Improvements - Younosomy Game

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive balance overhaul implemented to make the game more challenging, educational, and fair across all difficulty levels.

---

## 1. ✅ RELATIVE HAPPINESS SYSTEM (CRITICAL FIX)

### Problem:
- Somalia players lost immediately because absolute happiness was low
- USA players won easily because absolute happiness stayed high
- No country-specific context for citizen expectations

### Solution:
**Happiness is now calculated RELATIVE to initial stats**, not absolute values.

**New Formula:**
```typescript
happiness = initialHappiness + changes_from_baseline

Changes tracked:
- GDP growth/decline from start
- Unemployment change from initial rate
- Inflation change from initial rate
- Security improvements/decline
- Military strength changes
```

### Impact:
- **Somalia**: People start expecting poor conditions, react to improvements
- **USA**: People expect high standards, get angry if you let things slip
- **ALL countries**: Must actively manage and improve to keep people happy
- Natural decay added: Happiness slowly drops if you don't act

---

## 2. ✅ PERCENTAGE-BASED ACTIONS (SCALES WITH ECONOMY)

### Problem:
- Fixed $10B spending became meaningless with quadrillions
- Turned into mindless clicking game
- No educational value about proportional spending

### Solution:
**All actions now use percentages of GDP or Treasury:**

| Action | Old (Fixed) | New (Percentage) |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| Print Money | $10B | 1% of GDP |
| Sector Investment | $10B | 5% of Treasury |
| Add to Reserves | $10B | 10% of Treasury |
| Borrow from IMF | $100B | 10% of GDP |
| Declare War | $100B | 15% of GDP |
| Send Aid | $10B | 5% of Treasury |

### Impact:
- Actions scale with your economy size
- Early game: Smaller, manageable amounts
- Late game: Proportionally larger, still meaningful
- Educational: Teaches real economic policy concepts

---

## 3. ✅ SLOWED DOWN GROWTH RATES (REALISTIC GAMEPLAY)

### Problem:
- Treasury and GDP grew to quintillions in minutes
- Numbers became meaningless
- No time to make strategic decisions

### Solution:
**Dramatically reduced growth rates:**

```typescript
// GDP Growth (per day)
OLD: gdp * (1 + growth/100/365) * speedMultiplier
NEW: gdp * (1 + growth/100/365)  // Removed speed multiplier effect

// Daily Revenue
OLD: GDP * 0.0001  // 0.01% per day
NEW: GDP * 0.00001 // 0.001% per day (10x slower!)

// Treasury Growth
OLD: treasury + revenue
NEW: treasury + (revenue * 0.1)  // 90% slower accumulation
```

### Impact:
- More realistic economic simulation
- Time to think about each decision
- Numbers stay comprehensible longer
- Educational value: Real annual growth rates matter

---

## 4. ✅ FIXED MILITARY & SECURITY STATS

### Problem:
- Military stuck at 65%, Security at 80%
- Spending on these sectors had NO effect
- Made whole sectors useless

### Solution:
**Spending now actually updates the stats:**

```typescript
// In spendOnSector function:
if (sector === 'military') {
  militaryStrength += levelIncrease * 0.5
}
if (sector === 'security') {
  security += levelIncrease * 0.5
}
```

### Impact:
- Military and Security spending now meaningful
- Can build up defenses over time
- Can use military in wars and repressions
- Strategic depth added

---

## 5. ✅ SECTOR POTENTIALS (COUNTRY-SPECIFIC)

### Already Implemented (but now visible):
Each country has different sector potentials:

| Potential | Multiplier | Effect |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| Very High | 2.0x | Excellent returns |
| High | 1.5x | Good returns |
| Mid | 1.0x | Normal returns |
| Low | 0.3x | Poor returns |
| Very Low | -0.5x | NEGATIVE effect! |

**Examples:**
- **USA**: Tech, Military = Very High
- **Saudi Arabia**: Oil/Energy = Very High, Agriculture = Very Low
- **Russia**: Military, Natural Resources = Very High
- **Somalia**: Most sectors = Low/Very Low

### Impact:
- Play to your country's strengths
- Realistic economic simulation
- Bad investments hurt you
- Strategic depth

---

## 6. ✅ DIFFICULTY-BALANCED HAPPINESS DECAY

### Problem:
- Easy countries too easy (USA stays at 100%)
- Hard countries impossible (Somalia immediate death)

### Solution:
**Happiness naturally decays at difficulty-based rates:**

```typescript
const decayRate =
  country.difficulty === 'easy' ? 0.02 :    // Slow decay
  country.difficulty === 'medium' ? 0.05 :  // Medium decay
  country.difficulty === 'hard' ? 0.08      // Fast decay

happiness -= decayRate (per day)
```

### Impact:
- **Easy countries**: Must still act, but forgiving
- **Medium countries**: Constant management required
- **Hard countries**: Challenging but not impossible
- All countries require active play

---

## 7. ✅ NUMBER FORMATTING FIX

### Problem:
- Displayed "3.9805e+195B" (scientific notation)
- Unreadable and confusing

### Solution:
**Created formatCurrency() utility:**

```typescript
$456.78M   // Millions
$123.45B   // Billions
$789.12T   // Trillions
$3.98Q     // Quadrillions
```

Applied to:
- All stat panels
- Map overlays
- Game over screen
- Action buttons

---

## 8. ✅ INITIAL STATS TRACKING

### Added to GameState:
```typescript
initialStats: {
  gdp: number
  happiness: number
  unemployment: number
  inflation: number
  security: number
  militaryStrength: number
}
```

**Purpose:**
- Track baseline for relative happiness
- Calculate performance changes
- Enable smart difficulty scaling

---

## Summary of Changes by File:

### Core Logic:
- `types/game.ts` - Added initialStats field
- `hooks/useGameEngine.ts` - Initialize and store baselines, slowed growth
- `utils/gameCalculations.ts` - Complete rewrite of happiness formula, slowed revenue
- `utils/gameActions.ts` - Fixed military/security updates, percentage-based war cost
- `utils/formatting.ts` - NEW: Number formatting utility

### UI Components:
- `components/ComprehensiveStatsPanel.tsx` - Applied number formatting
- `components/GameWorldMap.tsx` - Applied number formatting to overlays
- `components/ImmersiveActionsPanel.tsx` - ALL actions now percentage-based
- `components/ComprehensiveGameUI.tsx` - Applied formatting to game over screen

---

## Expected Gameplay Changes:

### Before:
❌ Somalia = instant death
❌ USA = walk in the park
❌ Spending = mindless clicking
❌ Numbers = incomprehensible
❌ Military spending = useless
❌ Growth = too fast to think

### After:
✅ Somalia = challenging but winnable (improve from bad baseline)
✅ USA = must maintain high standards or people revolt
✅ Spending = strategic percentage decisions
✅ Numbers = readable and meaningful
✅ Military spending = builds actual defense
✅ Growth = realistic, time to strategize

---

## Testing Recommendations:

1. **Play Somalia (Hard):**
   - Happiness should start low but not immediately revolt
   - Small improvements should increase happiness
   - Focus on country's few strengths

2. **Play USA (Easy):**
   - Should NOT just win automatically
   - Happiness should decay if you neglect management
   - People expect you to maintain/improve high standards

3. **Test Scaling:**
   - Check that sector investments scale with treasury
   - Verify war costs scale with GDP
   - Ensure numbers stay readable into late game

4. **Test Military:**
   - Military spending should increase military strength stat
   - Security spending should increase security stat
   - Both should be usable in gameplay

---

## Future Improvements (Not Yet Implemented):

1. **World Events Impact** - Make AI events actually affect game state
2. **Auto-Save System** - Save every 30 seconds
3. **Action Cooldowns** - Prevent spamming same action
4. **More Random Events** - Disasters, scandals, opportunities
5. **Tax Adjustment** - Let players modify tax rate
6. **Alliance Benefits** - Trade bonuses, military support
7. **Sanction Impacts** - Actually hurt economy significantly
