# Session 2: Dynamic Gameplay Improvements

## Overview
This session focused on making the game more dynamic, strategic, and punishing bad economic decisions. We implemented critical anti-spam features, action cooldowns, debt management, and war requirements.

---

## 1. ‚úÖ ANTI-SPAM WARNING SYSTEM

### Problem:
Critical warnings like "Debt-to-GDP ratio dangerously high!" were sent EVERY DAY, completely clogging the event log.

### Solution:
**Implemented a sophisticated warning tracking system that only shows warnings once, then reminds every 30 days if the issue persists.**

**New System:**
```typescript
// Added to GameState:
lastWarningDay: {
  debtRatio: number
  inflation: number
  unemployment: number
  lowHappiness: number
}
```

**Warning Types & Cooldowns:**
| Warning Type | Trigger Condition | Cooldown | Icon |
|--------------|-------------------|----------|------|
| Debt Crisis | Debt-to-GDP > 150% | 30 days | üíÄ |
| Hyperinflation | Inflation > 10% | 30 days | üìà |
| High Unemployment | Unemployment > 15% | 30 days | üìâ |
| Low Happiness | Happiness 20-30% | 30 days | ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| Uprising Progress | Active uprising countdown | ALWAYS (time-critical!) | üî• |

**Impact:**
- Event log stays clean and readable
- Critical warnings still visible but not spammy
- Time-critical warnings (uprising) always shown
- Added new warnings for hyperinflation and unemployment

**Files Changed:**
- `types/game.ts` - Added lastWarningDay tracking
- `hooks/useGameEngine.ts` - Update tracking when warnings sent
- `utils/eventGenerator.ts` - Check cooldowns before sending warnings

---

## 2. ‚úÖ ACTION COOLDOWNS WITH VISUAL FEEDBACK

### Problem:
Players could spam actions infinitely (print money 100 times, borrow repeatedly). No strategy required.

### Solution:
**Implemented comprehensive cooldown system with visual progress bars.**

**Cooldown Duration by Action:**
| Action | Cooldown | Reason |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Print Money | 30 days | Prevent inflation abuse |
| Borrow from IMF | 90 days (3 months) | Borrowing should be strategic |
| Declare War | 180 days (6 months) | Wars are major commitments |
| Adjust Taxes | (Future) | Not yet implemented |

**Visual Feedback:**
- Red progress bar at bottom of button showing cooldown progress
- Days remaining displayed in top-right corner (e.g., "45d")
- Button disabled and greyed out during cooldown
- Sublabel changes to show "Cooldown: Xd"

**Example:**
```typescript
// Cooldowns automatically decrement each game tick
cooldowns: {
  printMoney: 30,  // Just used, 30 days until available
  borrowIMF: 0,    // Available now
  declareWar: 150, // 150 days remaining
  adjustTaxes: 0
}
```

**Implementation Details:**
- Cooldowns decrement each day in `runGameTick()`
- Actions check cooldown before executing
- UI shows visual progress bar with percentage completion
- Cooldown set when action succeeds

**Files Changed:**
- `types/game.ts` - Already had cooldowns field
- `hooks/useGameEngine.ts` - Decrement cooldowns each tick
- `utils/gameActions.ts` - Check and set cooldowns in actions
- `components/ImmersiveActionsPanel.tsx` - Visual feedback UI

---

## 3. ‚úÖ DEBT PAYOFF ACTION

### Problem:
Once you borrowed money, there was no way to pay it off early. Debt only decreased through monthly payments.

### Solution:
**Added "Pay Debt" action that lets you instantly reduce debt using treasury funds.**

**Features:**
- Costs 20% of treasury by default
- Reduces debt by that amount
- Improves debt-to-GDP ratio immediately
- **Bonus effects:**
  - +2 Global Reputation (fiscal responsibility)
  - +1 Happiness (people like debt reduction)
- Only appears when you have debt > 0

**Usage:**
Strategic players can now actively manage debt instead of just waiting for automatic payments.

**Example Flow:**
1. Borrow $100B from IMF
2. Invest wisely, economy grows
3. Use "Pay Debt" to pay off $20B at a time
4. Improve credit rating and public opinion

**Files Changed:**
- `utils/gameActions.ts` - Added `payOffDebt()` function
- `components/ImmersiveActionsPanel.tsx` - Added Pay Debt button to Quick Actions

---

## 4. ‚úÖ WAR REQUIREMENTS SYSTEM

### Problem:
Players could declare war at any time, even with zero military. Unrealistic and not strategic.

### Solution:
**Implemented strict requirements for declaring war. You must prepare your country first!**

**Requirements to Declare War:**
| Requirement | Minimum Value | Check |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| Military Strength | 40% | Can't fight with weak military |
| Domestic Security | 35% | Must control your own country first |
| Military Sector Level | 30 | Need military infrastructure |
| Treasury Funds | 15% of GDP | Wars are expensive |

**Error Messages:**
- "Military too weak! Need 40% strength (current: 25%)"
- "Domestic security too low! Need 35% (current: 20%)"
- "Insufficient military infrastructure! Need level 30 (current: 15)"
- "Insufficient funds to wage war (need 15% of GDP)"

**Impact:**
- Can't declare war on day 1
- Must invest in military first
- Strategic preparation required
- Prevents weak countries from starting wars they'll lose

**Files Changed:**
- `utils/gameActions.ts` - Added requirement checks to `declareWar()`

---

## 5. ‚úÖ IMPROVED ACTION VALIDATION

### Problem:
Some actions had weak validation or could be abused.

### Solution:
**Strengthened validation across all economic actions:**

**Print Money:**
- ‚úÖ Cooldown check (30 days)
- ‚úÖ Inflation check (can't print if >10%)
- ‚úÖ Amount validation

**Borrow from IMF:**
- ‚úÖ Cooldown check (90 days)
- ‚úÖ Maximum 50% of GDP (was 1000B fixed)
- ‚úÖ Scales with economy size

**Declare War:**
- ‚úÖ Cooldown check (180 days)
- ‚úÖ Military strength requirement
- ‚úÖ Security requirement
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure requirement
- ‚úÖ Cost 15% of GDP

  - Added war requirement validation
  - Changed borrowIMF max from 1000B to 50% of GDP

- **`utils/eventGenerator.ts`**

  - Check `lastWarningDay` before sending warnings
  - Added new warnings for hyperinflation and high unemployment
  - Uprising countdown always shown (time-critical)

### UI Components:
- **`components/ImmersiveActionsPanel.tsx`**
  - Added `cooldownDays` and `maxCooldown` props to ActionCard
  - Display cooldown progress bar and days remaining
  - Disable buttons during cooldowns
  - Added Pay Debt button to Quick Actions
  - Pass cooldown data to war and economic action buttons

## Expected Gameplay Changes:

### Before:
‚ùå Spam "Borrow from IMF" 50 times in a row
‚ùå Declare war with 0 military
‚ùå Event log clogged with same warning every day
‚ùå No way to pay off debt early
‚ùå Print money constantly with no consequences

### After:
‚úÖ Can only borrow every 90 days - must plan carefully
‚úÖ Must build up military before declaring war
‚úÖ Clean event log with warnings every 30 days
‚úÖ Can actively manage and reduce debt
‚úÖ Print money on 30-day cooldown - consequences matter

---

## Remaining Tasks for Next Session:

### High Priority:
1. **Make economic mistakes have lasting consequences**
   - Bad debt should hurt growth long-term
   - Hyperinflation should take years to recover from
   - Defaults should tank reputation permanently

2. **Initial country relationships**
   - USA starts allied with UK, France, Canada
   - Russia starts with enemies (NATO countries)
   - Create realistic starting alliances/enemies

3. **Dynamic war messages**
   - "Your troops captured Beijing!"
   - "Enemy destroyed 20% of your military!"
   - Multiple messages showing war progress
   - War outcome affects stats

### Medium Priority:
4. **Differentiate sector types**
   - Revenue sectors (Tourism, Sports, Transport): Generate income, very expensive
   - Long-term sectors (Education, Health): Improve happiness/unemployment, moderate cost
   - Different formulas for each type

5. **War animations on map**
   - Flash effect between warring countries
   - Animated projectiles/explosions
   - Visual feedback for battle events

### Lower Priority:
6. **Auto-save system** (every 30 seconds)
7. **Tax adjustment action**
8. **More random events** (disasters, scandals, opportunities)
